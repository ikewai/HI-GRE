        The Hawai‘i Groundwater Recharge Tool allows users to evaluate how changes in land cover and climate can affect groundwater recharge. The web interface initially presents a baseline 
        condition representing 1978–2007 average rainfall and 2010 land cover. Users can change land cover over areas of their choice using tools provided in the website, or by importing 
        spatial datasets, such as shapefiles or raster files, specifying land-cover distribution. Users can also select a future climate condition (statistically downscaled projections of 
        rainfall for 2041–2071 under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 [

      ]). The web interface accesses a database of recharge simulations representing various possible combinations of land-cover and climate conditions, and returns the recharge corresponding 
      to the user’s input.

      Database of Recharge Simulations

    <p class="clearfix">
      The database consists of 58 recharge simulations for O‘ahu. Each simulation represents recharge that would result if the entire island was covered in one of the 29 land-cover 
      types from the studies by 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm6A59">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
      and
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>
      (table 1), under one of the two climate conditions: (1) 1978–2007 or (2) 2041–2071 RCP 8.5. When the user changes a land-cover or climate condition, the web interface retrieves 
      the recharge values for the area for the appropriate land cover and climate in the database.

    <h2>
      Source of the Values in the Database 
    </h2>
    <a target="_blank" href="../assets/SWB_concepts.jpg"><img src="../assets/SWB_concepts.jpg" alt="SWB Recharge Model Concept Diagram"></a>
    <p>
      The recharge values in the database were computed using the soil water-balance computer program (SWB) version 2.0 (
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm6A59">Westenbroek and others, 2018</a>
      ). SWB estimates groundwater recharge from precipitation, soil, land-cover, and other data.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWB accounts for water entering, leaving, and being stored within the soil on a daily basis. Most groundwater recharge originates as precipitation. 
      Irrigation contributes additional water in some areas (the net effect on groundwater resources may be positive or negative, depending on whether the 
      irrigation water comes from groundwater or surface water). Some of the water runs off the land surface or evaporates from wet surfaces. The remainder 
      infiltrates the soil, where it is subject to uptake by plants through transpiration (the combined effect of evaporation and transpiration is referred to 
      as “evapotranspiration”). In the soil water-balance computations of SWB, groundwater recharge occurs when more water infiltrates the soil than can be held 
      in the soil given its water-storing capacity, antecedent water content, and losses through evapotranspiration. In some areas, additional water is contributed 
      by leaks from ponds, reservoirs, water mains, sewer lines, and cesspools; in the SWB simulations, these contributions are considered “direct recharge” that 
      bypasses the evapotranspiration processes in the plant root zone.
    </p>---
    <p>
      Parameter input values used to generate the SWB simulations were derived from spatial datasets compiled by 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
      and 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>
      . However, SWB uses a rectangular-grid environment which differs from the mostly irregular (non-rectangular) polygon spatial datasets used by 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
      and 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>
      . In most cases, the gridded input for SWB was created using the following procedure:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The island of O‘ahu was discretized (divided) into a grid consisting of 75-meter square cells
      </li>
      <li>
        The SWB grid was overlaid onto the irregular-polygon datasets used by 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
        and 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using the “rasterize” and “translate” functions of 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://gdal.org/">GDAL/OGR contributors (2018)</a>
        , each cell in the SWB grid was assigned the land cover and associated parameter values 
        from the datasets of 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
        and 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a> 
        that corresponded to the center of the SWB cell.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Exceptions to the procedure described include:

    <h2>
      Limitations
    </h2>
    <p>
      Accuracy and relevance of the results generated by this web interface for certain applications is limited by the assumptions of the soil-water budget approach and the quality 
      of the various input data sets available for O‘ahu. A review of the limitations appears below, but more complete descriptions of limitations are given by 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
      and 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm6A59">Westenbroek and others (2018)</a>.
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>
        Difference in the evapotranspiration rates of native and non-native forests is poorly known.
      </li>
      <li>
        Projections of future precipitation are highly uncertain, particularly for the Hawaiian Islands (Keener and others, 2012);  alternative projections exist besides the one offered 
        by this website. In addition, the only climate-change parameter that can be changed with the web interface is rainfall; changes to other climate parameters, such as evapotranspiration 
        and the extent of fog contribution,  cannot be simulated with the current web interface.
      </li>
      <li>
          Results from this website are based on simulations using long-term average input data, and may not accurately simulate recharge for a short period.
      </li>
      <li>
          Land cover types may exist that are not among the ones included in this website.
      </li>
      <li>
          If the user changes a baseline non-urban area to urban, contributions from septic systems, cesspools, and water mains are not extended to the new urban areas; only areas that are urban in the baseline land-cover will continue to have these contributions. However, if a baseline urban area is converted to non-urban, the contributions will not be applied in the new non-urban area.
      </li>
      <li>
          The ability to assess changes in runoff related to changes in land cover, such as urban vs. vegetated surfaces, is limited.
      </li>
      <li>
          Estimates of runoff in basins that have no stream-gage data have high uncertainty.
      </li>
      <li>
          The process of groundwater discharge to the surface, and its potential effect on recharge, are not simulated.
      </li>
      <li>
          The possibility that water flows into a cell from adjacent cells—either in the surface or subsurface—is not included in the water balance.
      </li>
      <li>
          The web interface does not distinguish between scenarios that are plausible and those that are unrealistic. the user is responsible for assessing the plausibility of scenarios they test.
