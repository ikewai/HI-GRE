    <p class="clearfix">
      The Hawai‘i Groundwater Recharge Tool allows users to evaluate how changes in land cover and climate can affect groundwater recharge. The web interface initially presents a baseline 
      condition representing 1978–2007 average rainfall and 2010 land cover. Users can change land cover over areas of their choice using tools provided in the website, or by importing 
      spatial datasets, such as shapefiles or raster files, specifying land-cover distribution. Users can also select a future climate condition (statistically downscaled projections of 
      rainfall for 2041–2071 under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 
      [<a target="_blank" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2014JD022059">Elison Timm and others, 2015</a>]). 
      The web interface accesses a database of recharge simulations representing various possible combinations of land-cover and climate conditions, and returns the recharge corresponding 
      to the user’s input.

    <p class="clearfix">
      The database consists of 58 recharge simulations for O‘ahu. Each simulation represents recharge that would result if the entire island was covered in one of the 29 land-cover 
      types from the studies by 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm6A59">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
      and
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>
      (table 1), under one of the two climate conditions: (1) 1978–2007 or (2) 2041–2071 RCP 8.5. When the user changes a land-cover or climate condition, the web interface retrieves 
      the recharge values for the area for the appropriate land cover and climate in the database.

    <h2>
      Source of the Values in the Database 
    </h2>
    <a target="_blank" href="../assets/SWB_concepts.jpg"><img src="../assets/SWB_concepts.jpg" alt="SWB Recharge Model Concept Diagram"></a>
    <p>
      The recharge values in the database were computed using the soil water-balance computer program (SWB) version 2.0 
      (<a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm6A59">Westenbroek and others, 2018</a>). 
      SWB estimates groundwater recharge from precipitation, soil, land-cover, and other data.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWB accounts for water entering, leaving, and being stored within the soil on a daily basis. Most groundwater recharge originates as precipitation. 
      Irrigation contributes additional water in some areas (the net effect on groundwater resources may be positive or negative, depending on whether the 
      irrigation water comes from groundwater or surface water). Some of the water runs off the land surface or evaporates from wet surfaces. The remainder 
      infiltrates the soil, where it is subject to uptake by plants through transpiration (the combined effect of evaporation and transpiration is referred to 
      as “evapotranspiration”). In the soil water-balance computations of SWB, groundwater recharge occurs when more water infiltrates the soil than can be held 
      in the soil given its water-storing capacity, antecedent water content, and losses through evapotranspiration. In some areas, additional water is contributed 
      by leaks from ponds, reservoirs, water mains, sewer lines, and cesspools; in the SWB simulations, these contributions are considered “direct recharge” that 
      bypasses the evapotranspiration processes in the plant root zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parameter input values used to generate the SWB simulations were derived from spatial datasets compiled by 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
      and 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>. 
      However, SWB uses a rectangular-grid environment which differs from the mostly irregular (non-rectangular) polygon spatial datasets used by 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
      and 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>. 
      In most cases, the gridded input for SWB was created using the following procedure:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The island of O‘ahu was discretized (divided) into a grid consisting of 75-meter square cells
      </li>
      <li>
        The SWB grid was overlaid onto the irregular-polygon datasets used by 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
        and 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using the “rasterize” and “translate” functions of 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://gdal.org/">GDAL/OGR contributors (2018)</a>, 
        each cell in the SWB grid was assigned the land cover and associated parameter values 
        from the datasets of 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
        and 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a> 
        that corresponded to the center of the SWB cell.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Exceptions to the procedure described include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Maps of rainfall 
        (<a target="_blank" href="https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.4437">Frazier and others, 2016</a>) 
        and reference evapotranspiration 
        (<a target="_blank" href="http://evapotranspiration.geography.hawaii.edu/">Giambelluca and others, 2014</a>) 
        were already in gridded form, with square cells of about 240 by 240 meters. SWB uses the value closest to the center 
        of each SWB grid cell.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simulation of sugarcane uses a uniform root depth for the entire crop cycle; this approach differs from that of 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
        and 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Effluent rates from point input for cesspools and septic systems (Whittier and El-Kadi, 2009) were summed for each SWB cell and 
        only applied to developed land covers (codes 8, 9, 10, 31, and 32).
      </li>
      <li>
        Total water-main leakage estimated by 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
        was prorated to each SWB cell on the basis of the sum of the length of water-main lines within each SWB cell.
      </li>
      <li>
        SWB cells designated as developed (codes 8, 9, 10, 31, and 32) were assigned average values for perviousness, which differs 
        from the spatially variable perviousness values used by 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a>
        . The average values used in SWB cells were the area-weighted averages of perviousness for all polygons of a given developed 
        landcover (for example, “developed, high-intensity”) in the dataset used by 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        SWB cells designated as forest or other land covers with trees (codes 1, 3, 5, 25, and 28) were assigned average values for 
        canopy cover, which differs from the spatially variable canopy-cover values used by 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
        and 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>. 
        The average values used in SWB cells were the area-weighted averages of canopy cover for all polygons of a given land-cover 
        type (for example, “native forest”) in the dataset used by 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a>

    <h2>
      Limitations
    </h2>
    <p>
      Accuracy of the results generated by the Hawai‘i Groundwater Recharge Tool and their applicability for certain studies is limited 
      by the assumptions of the soil-water budget approach and the quality of the various input datasets available for O‘ahu. A review 
      of the limitations appears below, but more complete descriptions of limitations are given by 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
      and 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm6A59">Westenbroek and others (2018)</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Hawai‘i Groundwater Recharge Tool does not distinguish between user-defined scenarios that are plausible and those that 
        are unrealistic. Some land-cover types (and their parameter values) may not be applicable in all areas of the island 
        (for example, evapotranspiration coefficients for native forests, which typically are in high-rainfall areas, may not be 
        applicable in dry areas). Users are responsible for assessing the plausibility of scenarios they test.
      </li>
      <li>
        When designating an area as developed, high-intensity or developed, medium-intensity, users have the option of including storms 
        drains (codes 9 and 10) or not including storm drains (codes 31 and 32). Users are responsible for understanding the implications 
        of these options for their application; selection of the inappropriate option can have unintended results. In the 2010 baseline 
        landcover, storm drains are applied to medium- and high-intensity developed land covers only in selected aquifer systems 
        (<a target="_blank" href="http://files.hawaii.gov/dlnr/cwrm/planning/wrpp2008update/FINAL_WRPP_20080828.pdf">State of Hawaiʻi, 2008</a>),
        which is consistent with the procedure described by 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a>. 
        For most of O‘ahu, medium- and 
        high-intensity developed land covers have storm drains (codes 9 and 10). In more rural northern O‘ahu (aquifer systems 30401, 
        30402, 30403, 30601, and 30602), medium- and high-intensity developed land covers have no storm drains (codes 31 and 32). See 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a>
        for more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changing land cover to taro (code 26), water body (code 13), or reservoir (code 14) in areas that don’t already have them in 
        the baseline land cover can lead to gross errors. Recharge rates for these land covers are fixed values that were not computed 
        by the soil water-budget analysis, but were based on simplifying assumptions 
        (<a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a>) 
        that may not be transferrable to other locations.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Hawai‘i Groundwater Recharge Tool results are long-term average recharge rates, and may not accurately simulate recharge 
        over a short period.
      </li>
      <li>
        Land-cover types may exist that are not among the ones included in the Hawai‘i Groundwater Recharge Tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Estimates of runoff used in the SWB simulations have high uncertainty. Runoff is computed on the basis of runoff-to-rainfall 
        ratios which are based on basin-integrated stream-gage data. Runoff-to-rainfall ratios are not computed for specific land-cover 
        types and do not change when a user changes land cover. As a result, the Hawai‘i Groundwater Recharge Tool is not able to assess 
        changes in recharge related to differences in runoff for different land-cover types.
      </li>
      <li>
        Differences in the evapotranspiration rates of native and non-native forests are not well known.
      </li>
      <li>
        Projections of future precipitation are uncertain, particularly for the Hawaiian Islands 
        (<a target="_blank" href="https://pirca.org/2012/12/04/2012-pirca-full-report/">Keener and others, 2012</a>); 
        alternative projections exist besides the one offered by the Hawai‘i Groundwater Recharge Tool. In addition, the only 
        climate-change parameter that can be changed with the web interface is rainfall; changes to other climate parameters, 
        such as temperature, reference evapotranspiration, and the spatial extent of fog contribution, cannot be simulated with the 
        current Hawai‘i Groundwater Recharge Tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        The process of groundwater discharge to the surface, and its potential effect of rejecting recharge, were not part of the 
        SWB simulations. The process of groundwater recharge from streams that lose water along their reaches due to seepage was 
        also not directly part of the SWB simulations, but was potentially accounted for by the basin-wide runoff integration of 
        the runoff-to-rainfall ratio method used by 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
        and 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The possibility that water flows into a cell from adjacent cells—either in the surface or subsurface—was not part of the SWB 
        simulations.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the user changes a baseline non-developed area to developed (codes 8, 9, 10, 31, and 32), contributions from septic systems, 
        cesspools, and water mains are not extended to the new developed areas; only areas that are developed in the baseline land cover 
        will continue to have these contributions. However, if a baseline developed area is converted to non-developed, these contributions 
        will not be applied in the new non-developed area.
      </li>
      <li>
        The users’ ability to change land cover and climate in the Hawai‘i Groundwater Recharge Tool is limited by the grid-cell dimensions. 
        Only cells whose center is within the users’ change shape will be converted according to users’ designation. Shapes that are smaller 
        than the 75-meter square cells or highly complicated may not produce the changes intended by the user.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conversion from the irregular-polygon environment of the source publications 
        (<a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
        and 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>) 
        to the rectangular-grid environment of SWB can result in slight differences between the results in the source publication and the 
        Hawai‘i Groundwater Recharge Tool’s baseline land cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some land-cover types use simplifying assumptions that differ from published conditions for 2010 land cover by 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> 
        and 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>.
        For example, percentage pervious area for developed land-cover types and canopy cover for forested land-cover types are 
        area-weighted average values for each land cover based on estimated values for 2010 land-cover conditions.
