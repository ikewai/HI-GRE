      The Hawai‘i Groundwater Recharge Explorer (HiGRE) web interface allows users to study how changes in land cover and climate can affect groundwater recharge. The web interface initially presents a baseline condition representing 1978-2010 average rainfall conditions and 2010 land cover. Users can change land cover over areas of their choice, and (or) select a future climate condition (statistically downscaled projections of rainfall for 2041-2070 under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 [<a target="_blank" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2014JD022059">Elison Timm and others, 2015</a>]). The web interface accesses a database of recharge simulations representing various possible combinations of land-cover and climate conditions, and returns the recharge corresponding to the user’s input.

      The database consists of 58 recharge simulations for O‘ahu. Each simulation contains recharge values for the entire island for one of the 27 land-cover types from the study by <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a> (table 1), under one of the two climate conditions (1987-2010 or 2041-2017 RCP 8.5). When the user changes a land-cover or climate condition, the web interface retrieves the recharge values for the area for the appropriate land cover and climate in the database.

      Source of the Values in the Database 
    </h2>
    <a target="_blank" href="../assets/SWB_concepts.jpg"><img src="../assets/SWB_concepts.jpg" alt="SWB Recharge Model Concept Diagram"></a>
    <p>
      The recharge values in the data base were computed using the USGS soil water-balance program SWB version 2.0 (<a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm6A59">Westenbroek and others, 2018</a>). SWB is a computer program that estimates groundwater recharge from precipitation, soil, and land-cover data. 
    </p>
    <p>
      SWB accounts for water entering, leaving, and being stored within the soil on a daily basis. Most groundwater recharge originates as precipitation. Irrigation contributes additional water in some areas. Some of the water from precipitation and irrigation runs off the land surface or is evaporated from wet surfaces. The remainder infiltrates the soil where it is subject to further losses through plant transpiration. The combined effect of evaporation and transpiration is referred to as “evapotranspiration.” In the soil water-balance computations of SWB, groundwater recharge occurs when more water infiltrates the soil than can be held in the soil given its water-storing capacity, antecedent water content, and losses through evapotranspiration. In some areas, additional water is contributed by leaks from artificial structures such as ponds, reservoirs, water mains, sewer lines, and cesspools. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Parameter input values used to generate the SWB simulations were derived from spatial data sets compiled for publications by <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155164">Izuka and others (2018)</a>. SWB uses a regular-grid environment for input of data and output of results. To generate the simulations accessed by the web interface, the island of O‘ahu was discretized into a grid of 75-m square cells. The spatial data sets from the previous publications, however, consisted of irregular shapes. To generate the gridded input data sets for SWB, the 75-m SWB grid was overlaid onto the data sets from the previous publications, and each cell in the SWB grid was assigned the value from the previous-publications’ dataset that corresponded to the center of the SWB cell. Rainfall (<a target="_blank" href="https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.4437">Frazier and others, 2016</a>) and evapotranspiration (<a target="_blank" href="http://evapotranspiration.geography.hawaii.edu/">Giambelluca and others, 2014</a>) were left at the original grid size (about 240 m), effluent rates from point input (Whittier and El-Kadi, 2009) for cesspools and septic systems were summed over each SWB cell, and the total water-main leakage was distributed over the water main system (Board of Water Supply, written communication) and assigned to each cell by the amount of intersection from the lines with the SWB cell. All other spatial input parameters were rasterized at the centroid of the SWB grid using <a target="_blank" href="https://gdal.org/">GDAL/OGR contributors (2018)</a>.

    <h2>
      Limitations
    </h2>
    <p>
      Accuracy and relevance of the results generated by this web interface for certain applications is limited by the assumptions of the soil-water budget approach and the quality of the various input data sets available for O‘ahu. A review of the limitations appears below, but more complete descriptions of limitations are given by <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155010">Engott and others (2017)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm6A59">Westenbroek and others (2018)</a>.
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>
        Difference in the evapotranspiration rates of native and non-native forests is poorly known.
      </li>
      <li>
        Projections of future precipitation are highly uncertain, particularly for the Hawaiian Islands (Keener and others, 2012);  alternative projections exist besides the one offered by this website. In addition, the only climate-change parameter that can be changed with the web interface is rainfall; changes to other climate parameters, such as evapotranspiration and the extent of fog contribution,  cannot be simulated with the current web interface.
      </li>
      <li>
          Results from this website are based on simulations using long-term average input data, and may not accurately simulate recharge for a short period.
      </li>
      <li>
          Land cover types may exist that are not among the ones included in this website.
      </li>
      <li>
          If the user changes a baseline non-urban area to urban, contributions from septic systems, cesspools, and water mains are not extended to the new urban areas; only areas that are urban in the baseline land-cover will continue to have these contributions. However, if a baseline urban area is converted to non-urban, the contributions will not be applied in the new non-urban area.
      </li>
      <li>
          The ability to assess changes in runoff related to changes in land cover, such as urban vs. vegetated surfaces, is limited.
      </li>
      <li>
          Estimates of runoff in basins that have no stream-gage data have high uncertainty.
      </li>
      <li>
          The process of groundwater discharge to the surface, and its potential effect on recharge, are not simulated.
      </li>
      <li>
          The possibility that water flows into a cell from adjacent cells—either in the surface or subsurface—is not included in the water balance.
      </li>
      <li>
          The web interface does not distinguish between scenarios that are plausible and those that are unrealistic. the user is responsible for assessing the plausibility of scenarios they test.
