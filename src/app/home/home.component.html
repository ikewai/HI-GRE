<p>The only source of freshwater to O‘ahu’s aquifers is
  recharge. Accurate estimates of recharge are critical for
  groundwater-resource management and planning. This
  website allows users to evaluate the effects of land-
  cover and climate changes on groundwater recharge on
  O‘ahu.
  Recharge ultimately comes from precipitation. On O‘ahu,
  most precipitation is in the form of rain, with some
  contribution from fog. Only a fraction of the water from
  precipitation contributes to recharge; the remainder
  runs off to the ocean by way of streams, or returns to
  the atmosphere through evapotranspiration
  (evaporation and transpiration by plants).
  Changes in land cover can affect recharge because
  different types of vegetation and land use have different
  rates of evapotranspiration. Irrigation of crops, parks,
  and golf courses can enhance recharge. In urban areas,
  paved surfaces can reduce recharge whereas leaking
  water mains can increase recharge. Changes in precipitation caused by climate changes can also affect recharge rates.
  This website provides a baseline estimate of recharge representing recent conditions of precipitation (1997-2008 average) and land-use (2010).
  Users can change land cover and rainfall conditions to explore the effects on groundwater recharge. Results will be displayed as on-screen
  maps, and users will be given options to generate interpretive graphics or export results in various formats.
  Results from this website are based on soil water-balance models. The user is responsible for understanding the limitations of the method and
  the appropriate use of the web interface.</p>
